This is an empty repo.

It's supposed to collect various automations in python, usually triggered on startup.

Do *all* python stuff, unironically, actually and consistently with `uv`

These will, eventually, be quite a lot, so think about clean architecture.

We will have a gitignored config.yaml, with a config.yaml.demo.

For now, we will have these things that should be analyzed:

- From config use `obsidian-vault-path` to count the number of `.md` files in this path (recursive)
- using `github-username` and `github-token`, fetch the user's github repos from github (may be more than 100, use the cli properly, with pagination). Only repos directly owned by this user.

Have an (also gitignored) file-based log system where you write what was run at which timestamp and what the relevant result was.
For now, this will be used for:
- checking if the github repo counter was already run today (calendar date), if so, don't run again.

Another important component, to be cleanly architectured:

- generate an HTML page with certain key stats, for now:
    - number of repos
    - number of obs vault md files
- use tailwind via CDN for css
- use a grid layout
- the point is to then convert this html page to an image, and set it as Ubuntu background.
    - allow setting the intended screen size via yaml props, default 2560 x 1600

There should be one single main command running the automations, which can 
    1. be run easily and reliably from ubuntu startup facilities
    2. can be ran in terminal to do a sort of manual refresh

It's fine if stuff is Ubuntu specific, this is personal software.
